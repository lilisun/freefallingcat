Report is here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eMSqCov8mwPpDX_cz6IRbKqfwO4QQsSA/view?usp=sharing Please download the report for click-able links rather than viewing it in Drive.

Videos of the controller running are linked in the report, however here they are as well:

To run the system, run freefallingcat.ipynb in DeepNote. The other two notebooks (ballrpy_attempt and urdf_attempt) were attempts at modeling which did not work ultimately.
